## Descriptin

```
  I started this project using 'create-react-app-redux'git
  In this project, I used Redux-thunk middleware for API integration.
  And I used Traditional React File Structure in this project.

  From it's structure, anyone could guess where to add presentational components and container components.

  Because Reducers and Actions was decoupled from store,
  we can easily add another features for maintaining the projects,
  and this structure will be adaptable for the large scale projects.
